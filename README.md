# Virtual Devices

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey. You can operate the Virtual Devices from the UI and/or use them in flows.

Or you can add a mode and add it as a condition, e.g. to disable multiple flows when going on Holiday.

## What works:

* Virtual Devices: Switch, Alarm, Blinds, Hifi, Light, Security, TV, Heater
* Modes: Holiday, Away, Party, Event, Quiet, Movie, Sleep, Relax, Manual, Secure
* Multi-modes: have a mode with more than 2 states, with custom names
* Trigger a flow
* Use the switch/mode status as a condition
* Use the switch/mode in the 'then'-column

## What doesn't:

* Settings (or other) that makes some modes mutually exclusive (issue #3)

I'm very interested to hear your ideas for other virtual devices.
