This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey. You can operate the Virtual Devices from the UI and/or use them in flows.

Or you can add a mode and add it as a condition, e.g. to disable multiple flows when going on Holiday.

## Features:

* Virtual Devices: Switch, Alarm, Blinds, Hifi, Light, Security, TV, Heater
* Modes: Holiday, Away, Party, Event, Quiet, Movie, Sleep, Relax, Manual, Secure
* Trigger a flow
* Use the switch/mode status as a condition
* Use the switch/mode in the 'then'-column
