## Mode

A mode can be used to set the mode of your house, family, user, etc.

### Flow-cards

A flow can be triggered with the default trigger-cards 'mode on|off' or the custom trigger cards: 'mode is on|off'. They work similar, but the big difference is that the custom trigger cards are not triggered when the mode is set in another flow with the action-cards 'Set mode on|off, no trigger'.
